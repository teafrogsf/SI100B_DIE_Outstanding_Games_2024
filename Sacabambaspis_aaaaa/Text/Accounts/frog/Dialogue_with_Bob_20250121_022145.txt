0   	Hi Bob

Bob   	*looks up from the book I was reading, slightly surprised to see you standing there* Ah, hello! Welcome back. It's been a while since we've met again. What brings you here? Are you looking for something in particular?

*folds arms, looking curious and interested* By the way, have you heard any news about our world lately? The big changes that happened after...you know, when you saved us all from the monsters.

*skeptical expression*

Oh, by the way, I've been keeping busy with my shop. Just restocking some new items for customers who come in here.

*pulls out a parchment with the price table, spreads it wide on the counter*

Prices like so:

(1)Weapons:
1. 'Soul gun': 20 Soulstones,
2. 'Firing gun': 30 Soulstones,
...
2. 'Speeding up': 10 Soulstones,
3. 'Solid body': 15 Soulstones,
4. 'Magician': 25 Soulstones,

*looks at you expectantly*

Do you need anything?

Bob   	*eyes light up slightly, noticing the slight increase in 

0   	Firing gun

Bob   	I can prepare that for you. *picks up the 'Firing gun' from behind the counter and hands it to you*

Here is your newly purchased 'Firing gun'. This should serve as a good companion in your...adventures ahead.

*wipes down the counter with a cloth, giving you a friendly smile*

So, how are you planning on using this new gun? Do you have any...leads or information about what's been going on since you last saved us?

*leans back against the counter, eyes sparkling with interest*

By the way, I've got some spare parts and accessories for it if you need them. Just let me know.

*sits up straight again, ready to discuss anything you'd like*

Bob   	*pulls out the 'Magician' from behind the counter, a hint of pride in my voice*

Ah, I knew that one would come in handy for someone with your...mystical abilities. *hands it to you with a smile*

This should give you a nice boost to your magic power. Do be careful not to overextend yourself, though. Magic can be tricky to control.

*winks* And if you ever need any help or advice on how to use this one, I'm here for you. Just let me know what's on your mind.

*sits back down behind the counter, watching you with a thoughtful expression*

You know, I've been thinking...I heard rumors that the Philosopher's Stone might be hiding in a temple somewhere. Have you given any more thought to your plan?
