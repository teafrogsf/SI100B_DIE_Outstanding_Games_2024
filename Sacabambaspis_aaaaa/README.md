- When a bullet goes outside the screen, it will be removed.
- When you have defeated all enemies and both of you (If someone is defeated or it's a single-player game, then one player is also accepted) are beside the portal, you can press **Space** to enter the portal and win !

- Haven't remember the steps above? Don't worry! After you have defeated all enemies, everything you should do is just to follow the tips in the bottom right corner of the screen.
